this program is supposed to:

Use the hand-drawn scene created in Project 3 and reproduce each object using primitives.
Use the virtual camera to display the desired perspective of the scene.
Use 3D primitives and various transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling, to reproduce the main objects of the scene. Maintain the relative size of all objects. Use solid colors for now (e.g., green for tree leaves, blue for sky).
