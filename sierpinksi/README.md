# Sierpinksi Gasket Using OpenGL

___

### The purpose of this project is to become acquainted with the textbook and OpenGL.

1. Read the assigned reading in the textbook very carefully, especially Chapter 2.
2. Review the code examples.
3. Using OpenGL and C++, draw three different versions of the Sierpinski Gasket, of your choosing (including 2D and 3D ones). This is traditionally the 'Hello World' equivalent of OpenGL.
4. Experiment with different values of the gasket's dimensional characteristics so you get a better understanding how these changes affect the final output.

___

### Project Setup:

1. Your environment must have paths to the <b>OpenGL API</b>
2. Copy&Paste or Download RAW of either sierpinski2d.cpp or sierpinksi3d.cpp into an OpenGL project environment
3. You may have to rename the file to main.cpp if the build settings are set to run a main.cpp
